Currently it does not do much but this are the features i would like to implement in the future:

1. User registration using github, google, twitter etc.
1. Multigame platform (Host any number of games at the same time)
1. Multiplayer with live updates probably using socket.io
1. SVG all the way, currently the app uses png sprites.
